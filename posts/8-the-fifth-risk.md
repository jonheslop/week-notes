I finished reading _The Fifth Risk_ by Michael Lewis today, even as a person who already believes in the value and importance of state run services, it really did highlight the incredible work that goes on that we don’t hear about (unless is goes wrong).

Government funds research and development that the market would never consider and yet down the line they reap the benefit. It also hits you with regular pangs of despair about how the Trump admin&shy;istration is handling things such as climate change.

The final section is a little Hollywood but overall it’s a fun, easy read.

The [Guardian published a version](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team) of the first chapter as part of _[The long read](https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read)_ series.
