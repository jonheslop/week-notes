- On Monday I went to see [And So I Watch You From Afar](https://www.asiwyfa.com) play through their debut album it was huge and properly good. Every track is a banger.
- After that I basically had a cold the rest of week which is not worth talking about.
- The vid of AOC grilling Zuckerberg is brilliant. He and Facebook have so much to answer for.
- Adjacently related [this LRB piece on America](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n18/eliot-weinberger/one-summer-in-america) was really depressing (and long) but I couldn’t help reading it all.
- On Friday I saw [Battles](https://www.bttls.com/) which was bangin’. I haven’t seen anyone play drums like he does. Although they were having some sort of technical issues with a synth or something, I couldn’t hear anything wrong but it seemed to be stressing them out. I often wonder what that must feel like, artists having a bad time on stage whilst the crowd is loving it anyway… tricky.
- Bec and I peeled 8kgs of onions and jarred them in vinegar, this is becoming a proper Christmas tradition now.
