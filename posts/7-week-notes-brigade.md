As uncomfortable as it makes me feel, I am going to try and give this week notes thing a try. I’d like to get better at communicating what I do and I think the discipline will be good for me. Hopefully it’ll serve as some sort of coherent record of what I have been doing.

So this is it, a static site powered by [Eleventy]. It’s based on the [Eleventy base blog] but styled with [Tachyons]. It rebuilds and deploys automatically when changes are pushed to [Github], using [Now] by [Zeit], which makes it effortless.
