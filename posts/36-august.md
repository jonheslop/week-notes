## Podcasts

Over the summer [Talking Politics] has done a great batch of guides. I particularly enjoyed [European Union before the EU], [The Euro], [The Chinese Communist Party] and [Marriage].

Also Novara Media’s [#ACFM series] is really interesting too, I well wanna go to one of [Jeremy Gilbert’s] psychadelic dance parties now.

## Blogs

\~13 years ago I was basically addicted to [Google Reader] and RSS. Every morning I’d have about 100 unread things. Over time I used it less and less, probably because of Twitter. But I’ve decided to give it another go, people are blogging again and Twitter isn’t a reliable way to notice.

I was spurred on by the release of [NetNewsWire 5]. So I’ve now got a small list of blogs I’m following on it and it’s really fun to be tuning in this way again.

So far I’m not subscribing to many feeds but this is the list so far:
