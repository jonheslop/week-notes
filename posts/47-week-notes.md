- If you haven’t [registered to vote](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote) you have a few more days to do it, it takes less than 5 minutes
- It was my last day at GDS on Thursday, it’s been a long time coming but it suddenly happened all of a sudden and took me back a bit.
- Had a great evening at the pub with people though, thanks to everyone who came
- I was bought a [very nice book](https://www.workman.com/products/the-noma-guide-to-fermentation) I didn’t know existed by the [Noma](https://noma.dk/) people about fermatation. Very much looking forward to stinking out our kitchen
- [Sasha Baron Cohen gave a speech](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/sacha-baron-cohen-facebook-propaganda) this week at the Anti-Defamation League was pretty great and worth reading
- It reminded me about this [excellent mini essay](https://platforms.fyi/) by [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/) which very eloquently summises what is wrong with Twitter and Facebook and how some sort of negative feedback loop would benefit everyone.
- I’ve been enjoying [these daily drops](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=novara%20burner) of election coverage from [James Butler](https://twitter.com/piercepenniless/)
