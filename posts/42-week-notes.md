- I made my first non-government open source [contributions](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/3140) to [Deno](https://deno.land) which was exciting. They were only cop out CSS edits though, need to get brave and write some TypeScript.
- A couple of weeks ago I levelled up my nerd creds and got a myself a very small [mechanical keyboard](https://olkb.com/planck) it’s fun, but I am still slow at typing.
- MCD’s newsletter [Electric Eel](https://www.mcdbooks.com/electric_eel/) continues to be great.
