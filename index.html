My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little&nbsp;bastard!</p>

        <p class="f4 f3-ns lh-copy measure">You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Checkmate... You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Must go faster. What do they got in there? King Kong? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they&nbsp;should.</p>

        <p class="f4 f3-ns lh-copy measure">Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Must go faster. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!</p>
