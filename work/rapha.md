I joined Rapha as the first in-house developer and worked with a small team on a complete replatform moving the website, fulfilment and accounts on to Hybris. I was responsible for designing and building the front end of the&nbsp;website. I also worked with marketing on product releases and campaigns to produce exciting features using Wordpress.
