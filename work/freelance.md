For a few years I freelanced with several companies and lived in varied locations including Wales, Bristol, Berlin and San Francisco. I mainly worked with my friends, The Hieatts, on various projects for The Do Lectures, The Do Book Company and Hiut Denim. The latter two were new companies and I was involved in all aspects of the business, from building the website to helping to manage inventory and invoices. I worked with other small business too building bespoke themes for mainly Wordpress and Shopify.
