For a few years I freelanced with several companies and lived in varied locations including Wales, Bristol, Berlin and San Francisco. I mainly worked with my friends, The Hieatts, on various projects for [The Do Lectures](https://www.thedolectures.com/), [The Do Book Company](https://thedobook.co/) and [Hiut Denim](https://hiutdenim.co.uk/). The latter two were new companies and I was involved in all aspects of the business, from building the website to helping to manage inventory and invoices. I worked with other small business too building bespoke themes for mainly Wordpress and Shopify.
