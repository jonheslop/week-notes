Project Helios is the digital mothership of the Renaultâ€“Nissan alliance, the engine is currently deployed to 167 markets in 50 languages. In release prep we oversee the deployment of new features from any of the fourteen teams that contribute towards releases, we debug and choreograph the deployment. The Helios engine is rooted in Adobe Experience Manager CMS linked up with over 1000 different APIs with a BackboneJS front-end.
