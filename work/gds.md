Government Digital Service is part of the Cabinet Office and leads the digital transformation of government. I worked within [Government as a Platform](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/government-as-a-platform) specifically as the front end developer on [GOV.UK Pay](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/), which makes it quicker and easier for government services to process payments&nbsp;online.
